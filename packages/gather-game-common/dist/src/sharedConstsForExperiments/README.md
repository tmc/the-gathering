Put stuff in here that is just harmless constants specific to some feature, not core game logic.
As a rule of thumb, if it affects anything related to events.proto or the game server itself, it should NOT be here

The reason for this folder is to avoid codeowner tags on changes that Engine doesn't actually need to review, like Garden Town seed images or customState format.
